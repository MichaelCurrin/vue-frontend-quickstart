Vue is "The Progressive Frontend Framework".

It add can be interactivity to your website. Either as components on an existing site, or for designing your entire site as a Single-Page Application.

More readable and robust than jQuery. Vue is declarative so you don't have to worry about low-level operations like finding an element and changing its value.

Vue is similar to React, but many including myself believe that Vue is easier to learn and use.

## How it works

The Vue app is handled with an HTML page and a JS file which gets loaded on the frontend, loading additional JS modules if needed. This is friendly for frontend developers to work with, even if they know JavaScript but not Node.
