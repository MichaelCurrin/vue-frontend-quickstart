# Vue Frontend Quickstart docs

A simple project that uses Vue on the frontend, without using Node or a build or compile step.


## How it works

The Vue app is handled with one HTML page and a JS file which gets loaded on the frontend, loading additional JS modules if needed. This is friendly for frontend developers to work with, even if they know JavaScript but not Node.
